# Team Profile Generator

This Node.js command-line application displays summaries of each employee of a software engineering team on a HTML page from the data entered.

You will be require to use the `Inquirer` package (make sure to use Inquirer version 8.2.4), using the command `npm i inquirer@8.2.4` in your project folder.

There is also a unit test for every part of the code in order to keep the code maintainable.


## Acceptance Criteria

The application has to successfully take in user input through the command-line, the team puts in their data follwoing the prompts, then the application generates an HTML page which displays all the information in clean, formatted team roaster.

When starting the application, a user will need to enter the team manager's name, employee ID, email address, and office number. After that, there will be an option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team. And then the user must enter more information (ex. if you are an engineer you will have to put in your name, ID, email, and GitHub username).

Once everything is completed and the user has exited the application, the HTML will be generated.
